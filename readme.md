<h1>Shoe Maven</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
A transactional email I designed and coded for a fictional e-commerce shoe store called Shoe Maven. The goal of this email is to confirm the customer's order, including a detailed list of all items purchased and the final price.The email is responsive and works on all email clients. I used HTML, CSS, and Photoshop to create the email and Email on Acid to test it on different email clients.
